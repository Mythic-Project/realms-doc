## Delegation

Delegation allows governance token holders to assign their voting power to trusted community members, enabling more active participation in DAO governance while maintaining democratic principles.

### Understanding Delegation

Delegation is a powerful feature that:

* **Increases Participation**: Allows token holders to participate indirectly when they cannot vote directly
* **Leverages Expertise**: Enables specialized community members to make informed decisions
* **Maintains Flexibility**: Delegators can reclaim or redirect their voting power at any time
* **Preserves Democracy**: Each token retains its proportional voting weight

### How Delegation Works

When you delegate your tokens:

1. **Voting Power Transfer**: Your governance tokens' voting power is assigned to your chosen delegate
2. **Token Ownership**: You retain full ownership of your tokens
3. **Flexible Management**: You can change or revoke delegation at any time

### Delegating Your Voting Power

<Steps>
